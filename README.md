# Awesome TensorFlow  [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome)

A curated list of awesome TensorFlow experiments, libraries, and projects. Inspired by awesome-machine-learning.

## What is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. In other words, the best way to build deep learning models.
